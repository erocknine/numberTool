Built with React + Typescript + SASS
10/5/2020

## NumberTool

A number & USD exchange rate calculator using ExchangeRate-API for updated exchange rates.  
Built for the next time I experience a Wanderlust frenzy.  

Simple Typescript for typing, custom SASS, and simple eval() logic for calculator functions.  
Developers will need their own API key, or API for that matter, if to fiddle with API functionality.
